# A simple TUI for recoll

[Recoll](http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/) is a desktop search tool.

## Why?

Starting from about version 1.26.6 GUI started lagging a lot.

A simple solution: use TUI.

## How?

This tool is <100 lines in bash and uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

## Installation

Clone the repo and make a symbolic link to the `recoll_tui` file in
your PATH.

`recoll_tui` is the "main" file. There one can add key bindings.

Other files are for my own convenience.
